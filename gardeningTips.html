                <p>Want to start digging but don't know where to begin? Use this
                    beginner's guide to gardening for the
                    answers to your gardening questions. Keep reading for all of
                    the
                    basic gardening tips and tricks you'll
                    need to get started.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Light</b>: Most veggies, especially those that bear
                        fruit
                        (tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and
                        peppers, for example) need sun, and a lot of it.
                        Ideally,
                        you want a site with at least 8 hours of
                        direct sun per day. In less light, you can still grow
                        some
                        edibles; mainly leafy crops and herbs.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Soil</b>: Healthy, rich soil is the key to
                        a
                        successful and productive vegetable
                        garden, so don‚Äôt skip this step! A soil test will give
                        you
                        an idea of your existing soil fertility
                        and pH, and offer suggestions of what types of
                        fertilizers
                        or amendments will get your plot up to
                        par. In my own garden, I rely on homemade compost,
                        organic
                        well-composted animal manures, and
                        organic fertilizers like kelp meal and alfalfa meal.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Size</b>: A vegetable garden can be low-maintenance,
                        but
                        it‚Äôs not no-maintenance. Therefore, do
                        yourself a favor and stick to a small plot for the first
                        year or two. A 4 by 8 foot bed is ideal for
                        a starter veggie garden and will give you enough space
                        to
                        grow a handful of crops (see the next
                        point). If you wish to start even smaller, try planting
                        container-friendly veggies and herbs in pots
                        or window-boxes on a sunny deck.
                        <hr>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Plants</b>: With your first veggie garden, it‚Äôs very
                        tempting to want to grow everything! But,
                        for your own sake, I‚Äôd suggest you pick 4 to 5 types of
                        vegetables and grow them well. Trying to
                        cram too much in a compact space is asking for trouble
                        and
                        you‚Äôll end up with a smaller, not larger
                        harvest. However, you can boost yield by succession
                        planting. When your initial crops have been
                        harvested, follow up with a second sowing. For example,
                        follow spring lettuce with summer beans.
                        Succession planting allows you to stretch your harvest
                        season for the longest possible time.

                    <li><b>Bugs</b>: Ok, this might be hard to believe, but most
                        bugs are your friends! Yup, it‚Äôs true.
                        Think bees, butterflies, <a
                            href="http://savvygardening.com/snapped-good-guy-flies/"
                            target="_blank">tachinid flies</a>, ladybugs and
                        more!
                        To attract these good guys to your garden
                        ‚Äì and boost crop pollination ‚Äì include clumps of
                        insect-friendly plants like sweet alyssum, zinnias,
                        cosmos, and sunflowers between the veggies and herbs.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Water, weed & feed</b>: This might seem to be one of
                        the
                        most obvious vegetable gardening tips,
                        but new veggie gardeners may not know when or how much
                        to
                        water. Newly seeded beds will need
                        frequent watering, but most established crops can get by
                        on
                        one to two inches of water per week. To
                        conserve water and reduce the need to irrigate, mulch
                        your
                        soil with several inches of straw or
                        shredded leaves. Side benefit: the mulch will also
                        suppress
                        weeds! As for feeding, quick growing
                        crops like radishes and lettuce won‚Äôt need supplemental
                        fertilizers if grown in in fertile soil.
                        Long-term veggies like tomatoes, winter squash, and
                        eggplants, however, will appreciate a boost
                        several times over the growing season. Give them an
                        occasional dose of a water soluble organic
                        food to support growth and encourage the biggest
                        harvest.
